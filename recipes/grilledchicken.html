        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These juicy grilled chicken thighs are my family's favorite chicken dish. Easy to prepare and easy to grill! The marinade is made with orange juice, soy sauce, garlic, and herbs and adds so much flavor.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>¾ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>¾ cup orange juice</li>
            <li>⅓ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>⅓ cup ketchup</li>
            <li>⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Rinse chicken thighs and pat dry between paper towels. Transfer to a 1-gallon zip-top freezer bag.</li>
            <li>Mix soy sauce, orange juice, olive oil, ketchup, parsley, garlic, lemon juice, oregano, and pepper in a large bowl until marinade is well combined.</li>
            <li>Pour marinade over chicken thighs in the freezer bag. Squeeze out excess air, seal the bag, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken thighs from marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Cook chicken in a single layer on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chicken thighs should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
